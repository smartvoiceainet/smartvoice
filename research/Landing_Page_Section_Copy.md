## Problem/Pain Section

### Section Headline
"The Unseen Burden: What's Really Holding Your Practice Back?"

### Introduction Copy
"The constant ringing of the phone, a relentless siren stealing your focus. Every missed call represents a potential client lost. The administrative avalanche of scheduling, follow-ups, and client intake isn't just eating your time—it's consuming your passion for law and your ability to provide justice for your clients."

### Bullet Points of Pain
1. **Missed Calls & Lost Leads**  
   "Every unanswered ring is revenue walking out the door. In the competitive personal injury space, potential clients typically call 3+ firms simultaneously—and work with whoever responds first."

2. **Drowning in Administrative Tasks**  
   "You spent years mastering the law, not answering phones. Yet administrative tasks consume 67% of the average attorney's day, leaving precious little time for actual legal work."

3. **High Cost of Human Staff**  
   "Quality paralegals command $50,000-$70,000 annually, plus benefits and training—a crushing expense for solo practitioners and small firms trying to scale."

4. **Work-Life Imbalance & Burnout**  
   "The phone doesn't respect dinner time, weekends, or your child's soccer game. The constant tether to your practice is slowly eroding your personal life and wellbeing."

5. **Fear of Missed Deadlines & Errors**  
   "The nagging anxiety that something important will fall through the cracks grows with every new case. One missed deadline or communication error could damage a client's case—and your reputation."
