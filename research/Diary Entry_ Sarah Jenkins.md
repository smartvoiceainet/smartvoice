## Diary Entry: Sarah Jenkins

June 22, 2025

Another day bleeds into another night, and the only constant is this gnawing, suffocating feeling of *overwhelm*. It’s a physical weight, pressing down on my chest, making every breath feel shallow. The office phone, that relentless siren, has been ringing off the hook since 8 AM, each jingle a fresh demand on my already fractured attention. I swear, sometimes I can feel the vibrations in my teeth, a constant, low-level hum of impending doom. Every missed call feels like a missed opportunity, a potential client slipping through my fingers, and with them, the very lifeblood of my firm. How can I possibly deliver justice, fight for the injured, when I’m drowning in a sea of administrative minutiae?

The *frustration* is a hot, prickly sensation, like a thousand tiny needles pricking at my skin. It’s the same questions, the same repetitive tasks, day in and day out. “Can I speak to Sarah?” “What’s the status of my case?” “When can we schedule the deposition?” Each inquiry, though valid, pulls me away from the substantive legal work that actually matters. I look at the towering stacks of unfiled documents on my desk, a paper mountain threatening to avalanche and bury me alive. My inbox, a digital monster, spews forth new emails faster than I can possibly conquer them. And the phone… oh, the phone. It’s a tether, a chain, binding me to this endless cycle of answering, scheduling, and following up. I feel like a highly paid receptionist, not a legal advocate. The irony is a bitter taste in my mouth.

And then there’s the *anxiety*. It’s a cold knot in my stomach, tightening with every passing hour. What if I miss a critical deadline? What if a crucial piece of evidence gets misplaced in this chaos? The thought of losing a case, of failing a client who has put their trust in me, because of a clerical error or a missed communication, is a recurring nightmare that haunts my waking hours. I see my children’s tired faces when I come home late, again, and a wave of guilt washes over me. Am I sacrificing my family for a practice that feels like it’s constantly on the brink of collapse? The rising cost of everything, especially the elusive, reliable paralegal, just adds another layer to this suffocating fear. I’m caught between a rock and a hard place: I can’t afford more staff, but I can’t afford *not* to have more help. This firm, my dream, feels like it’s teetering on the edge, and I’m desperately trying to hold it all together with fraying threads. There has to be a better way. There just *has* to be.
