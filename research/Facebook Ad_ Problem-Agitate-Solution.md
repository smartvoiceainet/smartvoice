## Facebook Ad: Problem-Agitate-Solution

**A: Ask an obvious question where the answer is "yes"**

Are you a personal injury attorney constantly battling an overflowing inbox and a phone that never stops ringing, feeling like you’re drowning in administrative tasks instead of winning cases?

**B: Agitation of pain with 3-5 bullet points highlighting common pains**

We know the feeling. That gnawing *overwhelm* that steals your focus, turning every jingle of the phone into a fresh demand on your fractured attention. The *frustration* of repetitive tasks, pulling you away from the substantive legal work that truly matters. The *anxiety* that tightens in your stomach, whispering fears of missed deadlines, lost clients, and the constant pressure to scale without burning out. You’re caught in a relentless cycle, feeling like a highly paid receptionist, not the legal advocate you trained to be. The irony is a bitter taste, isn't it?

*   **Missed Opportunities:** Every unanswered call is a potential client slipping through your fingers, taking with them the very lifeblood of your firm.
*   **Administrative Overload:** Drowning in a sea of scheduling, follow-ups, and paperwork, leaving you no time for high-value legal strategy.
*   **Skyrocketing Costs:** The financial burden of hiring and retaining reliable paralegals and office assistants is eating into your profits.
*   **Work-Life Imbalance:** Your practice demands every waking hour, sacrificing precious family time and leading to an inevitable burnout.
*   **Constant Anxiety:** The fear of clerical errors, missed communications, or losing a case due to operational inefficiencies keeps you awake at night.
